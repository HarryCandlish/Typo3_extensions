# version_controlled
An extension to hold and track various files such as TypoScript, PageTS, CSS, JavaScript, DCEs, Front/Back End Templates, and more that would have otherwise been randomly scattered throughout fileadmin, user_upload, other nonsensical locations, or even stored in the database itself making version controlling either difficult or impossible.
